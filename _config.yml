# I was hoping we could move the .md files into a _docs/ subdir and keep
# the top-level repo dir less cluttered by setting a "root:" param or
# "include: [_docs]" or something but I could not get it to work, and
# even then we might need a "permalink: /foo.html" in every single
# page.  It does not seem worth it.
